# Covariance Matrix
Matrix such that the $j, k$th entry of the matrix is the [[Covariance]] of the $j$th component and the $k$th component of $x$. Note that the the $j,j$th entry of the matrix is the variance of the $j$th component of $x$
## Properties
A square matrix is a [[Covariance Matrix]] **iff** it is symmetric, and positive semi-definite. 
Another property of [[Covariance Matrix]] is that they're diagonalizable. 
#### Positive semi-definite
A matrix is positive semi-definite if $x^TCx\geq 0$ for every real vector $x$. We can check this through [[Sylvester's Criterion]].
