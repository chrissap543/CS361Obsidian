# Probability Distribution of Sample Mean
We are interested in the distribution of $T$ where
$$T=\frac{\text{mean}(x)-\text{popmean}(x)}{\text{stderr}(x)}$$
where $T$ is a random variable. 
The distribution of $T$ is a [[T-Distribution]] with $N-1$ [[Degrees of Freedom]]. 
If $N$ is large enough, we can replace $T$ with $Z$ and we have a [[Standard Normal Distribution]] for $Z$.
