# Normal Distribution
If a probability density function is the [[Standard Normal Distribution]] in standard coordinates, it is a [[Normal Distribution]]
$$p(x)=\left(\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\right)\exp\left(\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$
We then by definition have:
$$\begin{align*}\mu&=\mu\\\sigma^2&=\sigma^2\end{align*}$$
Note that
* 68% of the time, normal random variable within one standard deviation of mean
* 95% of the time, normal random variable within two standard deviations of mean
* 99% of the time, normal random variable within three standard deviations of the mean
